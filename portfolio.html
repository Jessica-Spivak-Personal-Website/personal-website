            I am extremely new to coding, but I do have one completed Java project that I made to help me learn Java.
            It is a practice test that I developed. It gives you the questions in a random order
            every time you run the program. If you put in the right answer it says "Correct!" and 
            gives you the next question. If you get the answer wrong, it says "Incorrect, please try
            again." and it adds that question to another array that you have the option of going through 
            once you have finished the test. If you put in another wrong answer for the same question, it 
            will not add it to the array again. If you put in an invalid option, it will tell you it's invalid 
            and have you try again. At the end it tells you how many questions you got wrong and gives 
            you your score percentage and asks you whether or not you want to go through the questions you got wrong.
