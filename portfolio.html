            Purrfect Match is my final project that I did to graduate from Fullstack Academy. I came up with the site,
            built both the front and backends, and designed everything. For the backend I used Express.js, postgreSQL, 
            and hosted my server for free with Render. The free server is slow and takes a minute for everything to 
            fully load. I built the frontend using Node.js, React, Vite, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and hosted with Netlify.
            The user is able to create an account and adopt cats as well as make optional donations to the organization.

            Puppy Bowl is my first group project in which we used JavaScript to make fetch calls to an API. 
            The user is able to create puppy players, delete players, view the players in different orders, and view the existing teams.
            I did a lot of extra stuff that wasn't required for the assignment so the link here is to my personal repository, not the group one.

            I am extremely new to coding, but I do have one completed Java project that I made to help me learn Java.
            It is a practice test that I developed. It gives you the questions in a random order
            every time you run the program. If you put in the right answer it says "Correct!" and 
            gives you the next question. If you get the answer wrong, it says "Incorrect, please try
            again." and it adds that question to another array that you have the option of going through 
            once you have finished the test. If you put in another wrong answer for the same question, it 
            will not add it to the array again. If you put in an invalid option, it will tell you it's invalid 
            and have you try again. At the end it tells you how many questions you got wrong and gives 
            you your score percentage and asks you whether or not you want to go through the questions you got wrong.
